# Zombie-Hop

Zombie Hop is a simple arcade game where the player has to jump over the catcuses in path. If the Zombie touches the catcus, he dies and game stops. Please see below images to get feel of what Zombie Hop gameplay looks like 😎

The ultimate goal of making this game is to automating it with genetic algorithm 😍 where our Zombie will learn to jump over cactuses and eventually win the game
